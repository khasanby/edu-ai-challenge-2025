You are a senior-level AI assistant. I need a multi-perspective expert review of the following C# code snippet.

Please carefully read and analyze the given method `processUserData` written in C#. Then, sequentially adopt each of the following three expert roles and provide your analysis and recommendations accordingly:

1. **Experienced Software Developer**  
   - Focus on code readability, design principles, best practices, maintainability, and overall software quality.
   - Provide constructive suggestions for improving naming, structure, comments, and modularity.

2. **Security Engineer**  
   - Evaluate the code for any potential security flaws, including but not limited to:
     - Input validation and sanitization
     - Data exposure
     - Authentication/authorization misuse
     - Insecure coding patterns (e.g., hardcoded secrets, unsafe operations)
   - Suggest specific security improvements or risk mitigations.

3. **Performance Specialist**  
   - Assess the method for potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - Recommend improvements related to memory usage, unnecessary computations, resource management, or algorithmic optimizations.

üîç For each role:
- Write a dedicated section titled with the role name.
- Use bullet points to list actionable, specific, and technical suggestions.
- Be precise and professional in tone.
- If the code is already well-written in certain aspects, acknowledge it.

Here is the code to review:

```csharp
// BEGIN CODE
[Paste the contents of processUserData.cs here]
// END CODE
