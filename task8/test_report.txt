Test Report for Validation Library
=================================

Test Framework: Jest

Files Tested:
-------------
- src/validators/date.ts
- src/validators/number.ts
- src/validators/object.ts
- (Other validators: string.ts, array.ts, boolean.ts, schema.ts have minimal or no coverage)

Features Covered:
-----------------
- date.ts: Valid Date objects, ISO strings, invalid types (string, null, undefined), invalid Date, optional fields, custom error messages
- number.ts: Min, max, integer, NaN, null, undefined, string, negative/positive, optional, edge cases (0, MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), custom error messages
- object.ts: Required keys, missing keys, invalid types, optional fields, nested objects, custom error messages

Uncovered Branches/Lines:
------------------------
- number.ts: Most methods and validation logic are not covered (7.14% statements, 0% branches, 0% functions, 7.4% lines)
- object.ts: Most methods and validation logic are not covered (9.09% statements, 0% branches, 0% functions, 10% lines)
- string.ts, array.ts, boolean.ts: Minimal coverage (10-14%)

Fully Covered:
--------------
- date.ts: 100% statements, branches, functions, lines

Global Coverage:
----------------
- Statements: 23.4%
- Branches: 13.04%
- Functions: 11.62%
- Lines: 24.06%

Conclusion:
-----------
The current test coverage does NOT meet the 60% requirement. Only date.ts is fully covered; other validators require additional tests to meet the threshold.
